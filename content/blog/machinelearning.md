# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance over time.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on labeled data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment.

## Example: Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple supervised learning algorithm.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Machine learning has applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. It's a rapidly evolving field with endless possibilities.
