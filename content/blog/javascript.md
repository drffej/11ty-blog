# Understanding JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive experiences for users.

## Key Concepts

### Variables
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. You can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

```javascript
let name = "John Doe";
const age = 30;
var isDeveloper = true;
```

### Data Types

JavaScript supports several data types, including:

Strings
Numbers
Booleans
Objects
Arrays
### Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

```
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
console.log(greet("Alice"));
```

JavaScript is an essential skill for web developers. Mastering its basics will lay the foundation for advanced topics like frameworks and libraries.
