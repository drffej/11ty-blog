# Exploring CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that simplifies the creation of complex web designs. It allows you to define rows and columns and place items within them.

## Defining a Grid

To create a grid, use the `display: grid;` property.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 10px;
}
```

### Placing Items

Use grid-column and grid-row to position items within the grid.
```css
.item {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 2;
}
```

CSS Grid is a game-changer for web developers. It provides flexibility and control over layouts, making responsive design more straightforward.
